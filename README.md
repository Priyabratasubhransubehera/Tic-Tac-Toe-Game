# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game 

A GUI-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python and the Tkinter library. This application allows two players to play interactively on the same system with a simple and user-friendly interface. The game automatically checks for winning conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals, and also detects tie situations. It is designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand Python GUI development, event handling, and game logic implementation.
